      <h3>AIMS</h3>
          Dog Walker aims to connect dog owners in the local region through providing a mobile application designed to improve the dog walking experience. Users will have the ability to see local dog walking destinations through the Dog Walker map. They are also provided with helpful information for their journey, such as the number of bins, hazards and water stops in the area as well as their locations. Dog Walker encourages users to track and upload their own walks to the Dog Walker map, giving them the ability to comment, review and mark out important spots along the walk to help out fellow dog walkers.

      <h3>TARGET AUDIENCE</h3>
      The target audience for Dog Walker is local dog walking communities and their dogs. By using information supplied by local users to build the framework of the map, it aims to bring local dog communities closer together by allowing them to share their favourite dog walking routes and communicate useful stops along the way. Dog Walker will allow users to communicate specific details about the walk to the local dog walking community. The app is designed to be friendly and easy to use in order to appeal to a wide variety of demographics.

      <h3>FIND A WALK</h3>

          <p>
          The 'Find Walk' function lets users view top rated dog walks in the local area through pathways marked on the Dog Walker map. Popularity of walks is visualised through the thickness of the green path surrounding that walk. Once a path is chosen, the app will display the name of the walk along with user reviews and comments. Marked locations for bin, water stops and hazards will appear once the path has been selected, as well as a GPS signal of how to get there. Once the user has completed the path they will be able to leave their own review along with any comments.

      <h3>MAP YOUR WALK</h3>

          <p>
          The 'Map Walk' function allows users to map their own dog walks and upload them to the Dog Walker map. Once the user has arrived at the location they would like to map, they can press the 'Begin Walk' button. The users GPS trail will then leave a green trail behind where the user has walked, tracking their progress. Once a user has completed their walk, they press the 'End Walk' buttons, where they are then able to leave a review and comment. The users can then upload their walk to the Dog Walker map for other local dog walkers to see and try for themselves.

      <h3>MARK LOCATIONS</h3>
	  <img src="marklocations.png" alt="">
          <p>
          The 'Mark Location' function enables users to mark bin locations, water stops and hazard locations as they walk their dog. Users are able to mark locations on either their own mapped walks or along other users submitted walks. Locations are marked by color coded blimps along the path, with the user selecting "Mark Location", pressing on the type of location they would like to mark and then pressing where on the map they would like to place it. This allows local dog owners to contribute and improve to their local Dog Walker map.

      <h3>VISUAL DIRECTION</h3>
          <img src="visuald.png" alt="">
          <p>
          The visual direction for Dog Walker is to use a cheerful colour palatte with simple, clean sillouettes and lines. The 'Find Walk' and 'Map Walk' will be connected through a main menu screen, which will allow users to differentiate between the two functions and decide what they would like to do. The interface will be simplistic and use colour coding to differentiate between certain things in the app such as water and hazards. Green has been chosen as the central colour for the Dog Walker app as it symbolises the natural environment that dog owners explore with their dogs.

      <h3>RESEARCH</h3>
    <p>
      The Wellington City Council provides a map which shows local dog walks and parks. This could form the basis of the Dog Walker map until new users upload their own paths. This map can be found <a href="https://wcc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=68b4be760e2b45d0ab859adf12225b25" title="here">here</a>. My own experience as a dog owner also contributed to the ideas within this application. I considered what could improved the overall dog walking experience in the local area. As Wellington is a city surrounded by nature, it is a great place to discover new places to walk your dog. The convenience of being able useful location along the walk would encourage practical use of the app.

      <h3>TECHNICAL CONSTRUCTION</h3>
      <p>
      Dog Walker will be built as a mobile application for tablets and mobile devices. It will make use of the GPS function within the users devices to track their location, and use the Google Maps API to source local information from around the area.
